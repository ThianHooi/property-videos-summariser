Offers a parcel collection system, air purifiers in common areas, and a centralized water filtration system.\\\\n- Unique Lower Floor Design: Lower-level units provide a \\\"landed housing feel\\\" with direct access from car parks to units.\\\\n- Impressive Facilities: Rooftop amenities capitalize on the panoramic horizon, featuring a forest trail, landscaped areas, and a 50-meter lap pool. \\\\n- High Sales Performance: Only two units remain, indicating strong market demand.\\\", \\\"cons\\\": \\\"- Early Stage of Development: The surrounding area is still under development, which may take considerable time. \\\\n- Extensive Use of Shear Walls: The structural system, while cost-effective, results in a prevalence of shear walls, impacting the spaciousness of common areas like the playground and urban farm. \\\\n- Design Quirks: The lack of a foyer in some units and the absence of balconies despite the expansive views are considered drawbacks.
